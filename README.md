# React Type
*React-Type* is a simple front end web application to practice typing common English words, and to test typing speed.

Created using the React framework.

```WIP: Some features of the site may not work.```

# Intended User Base

The development of this program is being developed first and foremost for casual typers, maybe someone who wants a quick few fast and responsive typing tests to warm up for a day of typing.

The websie is not intended for competetive typers and those who are trying to improve at typing in a very fast and efficient manner.

There are future plans to for ReactType to log your typing tests to give you an all around average, but that is not an urgent feature for the application at the moment. 
```Future plans for the application will be placed in changelog.md```

# Change log
