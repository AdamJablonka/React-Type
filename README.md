# React-Type

![reactTypeLogo](/assets/logo_gif_1.gif)

_React-Type_ is a simple front-end web application to practice typing common English words, and to test typing speed, created using the React framework.

`WIP: Some features of the site may not work.`

## Intended User Base

The primary focus of developing this program is to cater to casual typists who require a few quick and responsive typing tests to warm up before a day of typing.

This website is not designed for individuals seeking to enhance their typing skills for competitive purposes or to improve their typing speed and efficiency significantly.

There are plans for ReactType to log your typing tests to a database for each account, and maybe add typing sounds but development is currently postponed.
`Plans for the application will be placed in the changelog.md`
